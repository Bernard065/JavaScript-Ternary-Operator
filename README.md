# JavaScript-Ternary-Operator

The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way to write conditional statements. It's often referred to as the "conditional operator" or the "ternary conditional operator" because it takes three operands: a condition, an expression to be executed if the condition is true, and an expression to be executed if the condition is false.
The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:
```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```
